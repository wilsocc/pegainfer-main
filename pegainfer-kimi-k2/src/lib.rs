//! Text-only Kimi-K2.6 model crate.
//!
//! The current crate stage owns the compile-checked operator API surface and
//! text-only config probing. CUDA/runtime bodies land behind these headers.

#![allow(incomplete_features)]
// `use super::*` is the flat-module-layout idiom for these tightly-coupled
// submodules (weights.rs + weights/*, runner/worker.rs + worker/*), and the
// safetensors-mirroring field names (gate_proj, weight_packed, …) read clearer
// with their shared affix than without. Both are pedantic-only lints.
