//! vLLM-golden accuracy gate for Kimi-K2 — the first gate for this model line
//! that a fresh clone can re-run from committed code and fixtures alone (#223).
//!
//! vLLM is the reference, not HuggingFace: Kimi-K2.6 is INT4
//! (compressed-tensors), and vLLM executes the same quantized model through
//! marlin kernels — the closest equal-precision reference available. The HF
//! route decompresses to bf16 (a different numerical regime) behind a fragile
//! trust_remote_code load. The fixture
//! (`test_data/kimi-k2.6-vllm-golden.safetensors`, produced once on the
//! serving hardware by `tools/accuracy/dump_kimi_k2_vllm_golden.py`) pins the
//! prompt token ids, vLLM's greedy tail, and vLLM's top-K logprobs per
//! position.
//!
//! The TP1/DP8 path emits exact per-token logprobs (host log-softmax of the
//! full-vocab logits row, computed only when requested), so on top of token
//! comparison the gate bounds a two-sided |Δlogprob| distribution: pegainfer's
//! own logprob of its pick against vLLM's logprob of the same token. Two
//! passes through the *real serving path*
//! (EngineHandle → DP coordinator → DeepEP → MLA kernels, TP1/DP8/EP8):
//!
//!   * teacher-forced argmax sweep — for every position i, prefill
//!     `prompt + tail[..i]` with max_tokens=1. pegainfer's pick must satisfy
//!     the flatness-scaled regret rule (see `REGRET_BASE`): how far it may
//!     sit below vLLM's own argmax *in vLLM's logprobs* grows with vLLM's
//!     own uncertainty at that position — near-exact agreement where vLLM is
//!     confident, room for cross-engine noise where the distribution is flat
//!     and there is no single correct token. A pick vLLM ranks clearly worse
//!     — or not at all — is a real wrong-token bug, and an aggregate
//!     exact-match floor (`EXACT_FLOOR`) catches "many small flips" drift
//!     that passes position-by-position. Teacher-forcing means one flip
//!     cannot cascade: every position is independently comparable. This pass
//!     covers prefill numerics position-by-position.
//!   * free-greedy decode parity — generate the tail end-to-end and compare
//!     token-by-token. This is the only public way to exercise the *decode*
//!     kernels (MLA decode, batched DeepEP MoE), at the cost that comparison
//!     stops at the first benign divergence: an in-bound mismatch ends that
//!     sequence's comparison (the engines walked into different contexts); a
//!     mismatch beyond the regret bound fails the gate. An
//!     aggregate coverage floor keeps mass early divergence from passing
//!     silently. Runs sequentially (bs=1), concurrently (DP8 routing +
//!     batched decode), and twice on one sequence (determinism + warm-vs-cold
//!     prefix cache #230: identical inputs must reproduce identical tokens;
//!     logprobs within the paged-KV ULP wobble, see `DET_TOP1_TOLERANCE` and
//!     #293). Repeated prompts across passes also hit the prefix cache, so
//!     every bound in this gate exercises the cached-prefill path too.
//!
//! Requires 8 GPUs and Kimi-K2.6 weights. `PEGAINFER_TEST_MODEL_PATH` must
//! point at the weights and the fixture must exist — both fail loudly when
//! missing. No silent skip: a gate that can quietly report "ok 0.00s" guards
//! nothing (the qwen35 gate's env-gated skip taught us that). Building the
//! target at all requires the `kimi-k2` feature (`required-features` in
//! Cargo.toml), so feature-less workspace test runs never see it.
