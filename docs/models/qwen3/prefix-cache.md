# Qwen3-4B prefix cache

**TL;DR**: Prefix caching is on by default for Qwen3-4B. Full-block token-hash matching via the vendored kvbm radix tree, wired at the executor level. Repeated ~1900-token prompt: TTFT 141.8ms → 16.3ms p50 (8.7×); warm TTFT ≈ 1 decode TPOT (11.4ms) + ~5ms request-setup/eager-launch overhead. Accuracy gated by `hf_golden_gate` cached-replay surfaces (warm deltas at the cold bf16 floor).

Last touched: 2026-06

## How it works

- `Qwen3Executor::execute_prefill`/`execute_unified` call `RequestKv::match_and_add_prefix` before scheduling. Matched blocks advance `prefill_position`/`kv_position`; only the uncached suffix is forwarded (`PrefillStepItem::as_slice()` skips `cached_tokens`).
- Matching is full-block only (block = 16 tokens), keyed on kvbm `SequenceHash` (positional lineage hash of token content). Partial tail blocks never match.
- **Full-block cap**: `SchedulableSequence::match_and_add_prefix` caps matches at `(num_input_tokens - 1) / block_size` — a fully-cached prompt still recomputes ≥ 1 token (vLLM does the same). Without the cap the schedule/apply state machine deadlocks: prefill is "complete" with no forward pass to emit the first token, and the dangling-block count is wrong.
- **Echo requests skip matching** — prompt logprobs need every position forwarded.
- **LoRA-scoped**: the active adapter name is folded into the block-hash chain as a salt (`compute_salt_hash`, upstream router-parity recipe), so KV computed under one adapter (or the base model) never matches a request running under another. Same tokens + same adapter still share.
- Eviction safety: matched blocks are held as `ImmutableBlock` (strong Arc) in the sequence's assignments for the request lifetime; the inactive-pool LRU cannot reclaim them mid-request.
- Toggle: `Qwen3Executor::set_prefix_cache_enabled(false)` — used by tests that need cold determinism; there is no server flag.

## Numbers (RTX 5090, 2026-06, drained-stream measurement)

| Metric | p50 | p99 |
|---|---|---|
| cold TTFT (unique ~1900-token prompts) | 141.8ms | 205.8ms |
| warm TTFT (repeated prompt) | 16.3ms | 16.7ms |
| decode TPOT (bs=1) | 11.4ms | — |

Warm TTFT theory: the suffix is 1..16 tokens (cap + prompt length mod 16), and at 4B the forward is weight-bandwidth bound, so GPU time ≈ one decode step. The ~5.4ms gap over TPOT decomposes (measured by varying one factor at a time):

| Component | Cost | How isolated |
|---|---|---|
| tokenize ~1900-token prompt | ~2.9ms | warm TTFT − cold 16-token-prompt TTFT (16.8 − 13.9); HF tokenizers on the same string measures 3.2ms standalone, so radix match + block-table H2D inside this bucket are sub-ms |
| request setup (HTTP parse, admission, FlashInfer prefill-plan build, sampling readback, SSE) | ~1.7ms | cold 16-token-prompt TTFT − graph TPOT − eager-launch share |
| eager per-layer launches (suffix prefill is not graph-captured) | ~0.8ms | eager-decode TPOT (`--cuda-graph=false`) 12.18ms − graph TPOT 11.40ms |

Tokenization is the single largest term — for cached long prompts the CPU tokenizer costs more than everything the scheduler and kernels add on top of the forward pass. So the next lever for warm TTFT is the tokenizer, not the GPU path; graph-capturing the suffix prefill only buys ~0.8ms.

Supporting measurements behind the decomposition (all drained-stream, n=20, same session):

| Measurement | p50 |
|---|---|
| TTFT, 1-token prompt, cold | 13.4ms |
| TTFT, 16-token prompt, cold | 13.9ms |
| TTFT, ~1900-token prompt, warm | 16.8ms |
| TPOT, graph decode | 11.40ms |
| TPOT, eager decode (`--cuda-graph=false`) | 12.18ms |
| tokenize 1500-word prompt standalone (HF `tokenizers`, 1502 tokens) | 3.2ms |

Negative result: registering 40 extra unique ~1900-token prompts did not move warm TTFT p50 at all — radix-tree matching cost is flat at this registry scale (~5k blocks), so don't reach for match-cost optimizations without first reproducing a regression.

## Pitfalls

- **RoPE scalar-path corruption (fixed on this branch).** `prefill_attention_paged_into` had a `batch_size == 1` fast path that used a scalar `start_pos` (always 0 from the qwen3 call site) instead of the plan's per-token positions array. Cold runs were unaffected (start really is 0); warm bs=1 prefills rotated the suffix K/Q from position 0 and scattered the mis-rotated K into KV pages — decode drift up to 3.3 nat in `hf_golden_gate` cached replay. The scalar branch and its dead kernel wrapper (`prefill_qk_norm_rope_only_cuda`) are deleted; all callers go through the positions array, which is bit-identical for cold runs (both C entry points launched the same kernel). Lesson: a "fast path" that duplicates position logic is a fork that only breaks when positions stop being trivial.
- **TTFT measurement: drain the stream.** The server has no abort-on-disconnect — a client that hangs up after the first token leaves the request decoding its remaining tokens, and the *next* request's prefill contends with that zombie decode. Early-disconnect measurement inflated warm TTFT 16.3 → 25.5ms p50. Always read SSE to `[DONE]` between samples.
- **Cache-off runs still register blocks.** Disabling matching only skips lookup; completed blocks are still registered on apply. Tests use this: phase 1 (off) builds cold baselines *and* populates the cache for phase 2 (on).

## Tests

- `pegainfer-qwen3-4b/tests/prefix_cache.rs` — behavioral contract: exact cached-token counts (3-block hit + tail recompute, extension match, full-block cap edge), mixed cold+warm batch in one plan, unified prefill+decode path, warm-vs-cold logit bounds (regret + mean, golden-gate methodology).
- `pegainfer-qwen3-4b/tests/hf_golden_gate.rs` — cached-replay surfaces (sequential bs=1 eager, batched eager, batched cuda-graph) vs the HF golden: warm mean 0.0316 / p99 0.1215 vs cold floor 0.0317 / 0.1196.

```bash
PEGAINFER_TEST_MODEL_PATH=/data/models/Qwen3-4B cargo test --release -p pegainfer-qwen3-4b --test prefix_cache

```

## Next

- Abort-on-disconnect filed as #215 (zombie decode wastes GPU and pollutes TTFT measurement).
- Qwen3.5-4B adoption: the executor wiring pattern transfers, but the GDR linear-attention state is positional — cached prefix reuse needs the recurrent state snapshot, not just KV pages. Needs its own design note before attempting.
