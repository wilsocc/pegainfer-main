# Exact-Match Greedy Gates And Worker-Thread cuBLAS Binding

> **TL;DR:** A Qwen3.5 e2e "gibberish" regression carried two independent lessons worth keeping past the bug itself:
>
> - **Worker-thread CUDA binding:** any runtime that loads a model on one thread but runs prefill/decode on another must rebind the CUDA context and initialize that thread's thread-local CUDA library handles (cuBLAS). The regression first appeared at `6a5b826` once cuBLAS handles became `thread_local` and the Qwen3.5 scheduler thread was never given the equivalent binding the Qwen3 worker received.
> - **Exact-match greedy gates are tie-sensitive:** an exact golden-text regression can flip on equal-logit top1 choices. Keeping a single selector (FlashInfer top1) is lower maintenance than a model-side `argmax` branch, and the exact-text comparison is tied to the default engine shape.

## Scope

This note records a cross-cutting runtime/correctness lesson, not a Qwen3.5-only story. It was lifted from the original Qwen3.5 debugging debrief because the concrete fix shipped, but the transferable lessons still matter. The triggering bug was fixed in `pegainfer-qwen35-4b`, but the takeaways apply to any model crate that moves a model onto a worker thread or guards greedy decode with an exact-text gate.

## Background

The regression first appeared at `6a5b826` after cuBLAS handles became thread-local: Qwen3.5 loaded the model on one thread but ran scheduler prefill/decode on another without rebinding the CUDA context or initializing that thread's cuBLAS handles. At the time, Qwen3.5 greedy stayed on FlashInfer top1 and the default Qwen3.5 e2e was an exact golden-text regression against `test_data/Qwen3.5-4B.json`; that exact-text gate and JSON fixture have since been retired by the HF logits gate.

## How it was found

- **Read**:
  - `docs/index.md` - Qwen3.5 accuracy and optimization docs are the relevant references.
  - `docs/models/qwen35/model-crate.md` - confirmed the model-crate split reproduced the same Qwen3.5 e2e failure on old HEAD.
  - `git log -- pegainfer-qwen35-4b pegainfer-kernels ...` - identified Qwen3.5 and sampling-related commits since the last accuracy work (the historical bisect ran against the pre-split `src/model/qwen35` layout).
- **Relevant history**:
  - `docs/models/qwen35/model-crate.md` - old HEAD and the model-crate split both fail all 10 Qwen3.5 e2e cases with similar gibberish.
  - Commit history has a suspicious sampling change: `020970b refactor(sampling): switch greedy decode to flashinfer top1 (#73)`.

## Execution Log

### Step 1: Reproduce and bisect through history
- Created a temporary worktree so the active model-crate diff stayed untouched.
- Older commits needed the current local FlashInfer third-party tree copied into `third_party/flashinfer` and `PEGAINFER_TRITON_PYTHON` pointed at a Python with Triton.
- Results:
  - `24be186 refactor(embedding): keep token ids unsigned end-to-end (#71)` passed Qwen3.5 e2e.
  - `020970b refactor(sampling): switch greedy decode to flashinfer top1 (#73)` failed a few cases with normal text, matching baseline drift rather than gibberish.
  - `902b725 fix(scheduler): gate prefill admission on kv budget (#74)` still produced normal text.
  - `6a5b826 feat: Add Qwen3 tensor parallel runtime (#75)` failed all cases with repeated multilingual garbage tokens.
- The first gibberish commit also changed cuBLAS handles to `thread_local`, added `cuda_set_device`, and added Qwen3 worker-thread binding, but the Qwen3.5 scheduler did not receive equivalent binding.

### Step 2: Prove first-token corruption
- Added a temporary local `debug_tokens` test, then removed it after diagnosis.
- Before the fix, the first generated tokens for `What is the capital of France?` were `[207248, 207344, 83168, 165952, ...]`, decoding to fragments like `"단은"`, `" персонала"`, `"Mbps"`, and `"فيروس"`.
- That showed logits/sampling were already wrong at the first sampled token after prefill; decode KV accumulation was not the primary cause.

### Step 3: Fix scheduler thread binding
- Updated `pegainfer-qwen35-4b/src/scheduler.rs` so the scheduler thread:
  - calls `cuda_set_device` for the model device,
  - binds the existing `CudaContext` to the scheduler thread,
  - initializes thread-local cuBLAS handles on that thread,
  - destroys those handles on scheduler thread exit,
  - reports startup failures back to `start_with_capacity`.
- After this change, the same diagnostic prompt produced `"\n\nThe capital of France is"` instead of garbage.

### Step 4: Keep FlashInfer top1 as the greedy selector
- With thread binding fixed, Qwen3.5 generated normal text but a few cases drifted between valid continuations.
- A direct logits check found `Tell me a story` step 15 had two maximum bf16 logits: token `198` (`"\n"`) and token `271` (`"\n\n"`) were both `20.875`; equal-logit token choice can differ between selection implementations.
- A temporary Qwen3.5-side `argmax_into` branch made exact baselines deterministic, but it added model-side maintenance surface.
- The chosen fix keeps Qwen3.5 greedy on the existing FlashInfer `TopKDispatch(..., k=1)` path. A per-dispatch `cudaMemsetAsync` of `RadixRowState` was tested and removed because FlashInfer's wrapper zero-initializes the cached scratch and the radix top-k kernel resets its row state at the end of the launch.
- Two-run same-seed regen checks on the default engine produced byte-identical JSON in one sampled run (`FLASH_RESET_REGEN_DETERMINISTIC`), while reduced-capacity scheduler runs can still pick a different equal-logit branch because the engine shape changes.
- `test_data/Qwen3.5-4B.json` was refreshed to the then-current FlashInfer top1 output and became the hard golden for the default Qwen3.5 exact-text e2e.
- That exact-text e2e and `test_data/Qwen3.5-4B.json` are historical now. The current accuracy gate is the HF logits gate; `e2e_scheduler` remains a scheduler integration test for request-flow behavior rather than an exact-text replacement.

### Step 5: Validation
- Passed (set `PEGAINFER_CUDA_SM` only when overriding SM auto-detection):
  - `cargo fmt --all --check`
  - `cargo check --release --workspace --all-targets`
  - `cargo clippy --release --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings`
  - Two-run same-seed regen comparison with a temporary model alias while evaluating FlashInfer top1 behavior.
  - `cargo test --release -p pegainfer test_gpu_sample -- --nocapture`
  - `PEGAINFER_TEST_MODEL_PATH=<absolute Qwen3.5-4B path> cargo test --release -p pegainfer-qwen35-4b --test e2e -- --nocapture`
  - `PEGAINFER_TEST_MODEL_PATH=<absolute Qwen3.5-4B path> cargo test --release -p pegainfer-qwen35-4b --test e2e_scheduler -- --nocapture`
  - `git diff --check`

## Debrief

- **Outcome**: Qwen3.5 e2e and scheduler e2e pass again on the crate-split branch.
- **Pitfalls encountered**:
  - The first control run against an older worktree was misleading until the historical `third_party/flashinfer` layout and Triton Python environment were repaired.
  - The visible symptom had two layers: thread-local cuBLAS misuse caused true gibberish, while FlashInfer top1 caused deterministic-baseline instability after the main corruption was fixed.
- **Lessons learned**:
  - Any runtime that moves a model onto a worker thread must bind the CUDA context and initialize thread-local CUDA library handles inside that worker thread.
  - Greedy e2e baselines can be sensitive to equal-logit top1 choices. Keeping FlashInfer as the selector is lower maintenance, and the exact text comparison is tied to the default engine shape used by `tests/e2e.rs`.
